### 1)App   
The App Component is the parent compoent of AutoFill componet where the user can type input.The App component has essential functions and classes which are needed for the AutoFill Component to work effecintly.


### 2)AutoFill 
The Auto fill component is a stateless contolled component which takes props from its parent , which report its channges to the parents and fetch results accordingly.


### 3)Suggestion
The Autofill will display an array of suggestion for each incomplete word and these arey dispalyed in the form of pills.


## ðŸ’» Working/WorkFlow

### 1)Input
The AutoFill component has an event handler which calls the handleChange function whenever a change is done to the input.


### 2)handleChange 
The handle change function will make an api call for the incomplete word of the input and fetch suggestions from the server.


### 3)Caching (Optimisation using Trie)
In an effort to minimise redundant API Calls we have used a Trie for which stores the suggestions for different prefexes. The Trie is stored in our Cache(local storage of user) and is reset every 30 seconds. The system is checked for pre-existing Trie in Cache whenever the component is rendered.
